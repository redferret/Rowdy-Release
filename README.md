This is an interpreter, developed in Java, I wrote for Principals of Programming Languages. The interpretor uses recursive-decent parsing

Consult the [Rowdy Wiki](https://github.com/redferret/rowdy/wiki) for more information on the language

Assuming you have a Unix system for sh/zsh you can execute the rowdy or rowdy-terminal scripts to run Rowdy
You can also navigate to the `dist` directory and run `java -jar rowdy.jar` to enter the terminal for rowdy or run `java -jar rowdy.jar` `<relative path to the source>` `arg1` `arg2`. `arg1` and `arg2` are arguments the Rowdy program.
